		<h1>Element Definitions</h1>
		<p>Definitions, in my own words, of elements learned in Chapters 2 and 3 of HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Headings</dt>
				<dd>A way to separate content within a page using different sized titles.</dd>
			<dt>Paragraphs</dt>
				<dd>Paragraphs are made with the "p" tag surrounding the content that you would like to include in one paragraph.</dd>
			<b>Bold</b> &amp; <i>Italic</i>
				<dd>Each are ways to put an emphasis on words or sentences. Using the bold element places emphasis by making the words look <b>thicker</b>. Using the italic element places emphasis by giving the words a <i>forward slant.</i></dd>
			<dt>Superscript &amp; Subscript</dt>
				<dd>Superscript allows you to make things like mathematical notations, like raising a number to a power (10<sup>2</sup>) or the end of a date (December 1<sup>st</sup>). Subscript also allows you to complete equations, such as those for compounds like H<sub>2</sub>O.
			<dt>White Space</dt>
				<dd>White space is the blank space between words.</dd>
			<dt>Line Breaks &amp; Horizontal Rules</dt>
				<dd>Line breaks allow you to separate content within paragraphs. Horizontal rules help you to break up different content by simply placing a line between the old <hr /> and the new.</dd>
			<dt>Visual Editors</dt>
				<dd>Visual editors allow you to easily edit code with shortcuts rather than scripting it all from memory.</dd>
			<dt>Semantic Markup</dt>
				<dd>This adds meaning without affecting how your page looks. It lets you edit for things like screen readers and can give extra information to search engines about your page.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Strong</strong> &amp; <em>Emphasis</em></dt>
				<dd>These are similar to <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>. Strong is used to show that something holds <strong>great importance</strong>. Emphasis is used to change the meaning of a sentence, determined by your placement of the <em>emphasis</em>.
			<dt>Quotations</dt>
				<dd>Quotations can be made with the "q" and "blockquote" tags. "Blockquote" can be used for long quotes and "q" can be used for smaller quotes within larger content.</dd>
			<dt>Abbreviations &amp; Acronyms</dt>
				<dd>Rather than listing the name of a very long organization, you are able to instead list the acronym, such as <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>, and have the user scroll over it to see the whole name, which I have done within this definition!</dd>
			<dt>Citations &amp; Definitions</dt>
				<dd>Just as you would cite your references for a paper, the same is done for a web page. If I were to cite our textbook it would be shown as: <cite>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</cite> by Jon Duckett. With the definition element, some browsers will show the term in italics, and this could be used to draw attention to a new term.</dd>
			<dt>Author Details</dt>
				<dd>The "address" element allows you to display contact information, and is often shown in italics, depending on which browser is being used: <addresss><p><a href="mailto:oldengsr@fullsail.edu">oldengsr@gmail.com</a></p><p>3407 Summit Loop Drive, Williamsburg</p>
			<dt>Changes to Content</dt>
				<dd>Some changes that can be made to content include deletion, insertion and lining out. Deletion is used to show something that has been <del>removed</del>. Insertion is used to show something has been <ins>added</ins>. And by using the "s" element you could, for example, show an old price of something on sale. <s>It was &#36 500</s> But now it's &#36 199!</dd>
			<dt>Ordered Lists<dt>
				<dd>Ordered lists are lists that contain numbered elements.
				<ol>
					<li>Item 1</li>
					<li>Item 2</li>
					<li>Item 3</li>
				</ol></dd>
			<dt>Unordered Lists</dt>
				<dd>Unordered lists are lists that contain bulleted elements.
				<ul>
					<li>Item 1</li>
					<li>Item 2</li>
					<li>Item 3</li>
				</ul></dd>
			<dt>Definition Lists</dt>
				<dd>Definition Lists display terms along with their definitions. The definitions are indented and displayed one line after the term.
				<dl>
				<dt>Term</dt>
				<dd>Definition</dd>
				</dl><dd>
			<dt>Nested Lists</dt>
				<dd>Nested lists are lists within a list.
				<ul>
					<li>List</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Nested 1</li>
							<li>Nested 2</li>
						</ul>
				</dd>
