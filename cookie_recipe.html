		<p>These adorable Melted Snowman Cookies will put a smile on anyone's face this holiday!</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 package of Betty Crocker Sugar Cookie mix</li>
			<li>10 large marshmallows</li>
			<li>Betty Crocker Cookie Icing (white and orange)</li>
			<li>Wilton Decorating Icing Tubes in black, red, green, blue and pink</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Mix cookie mix according to the directions, then grab a golf ball sized chunk and squish it down until it's about 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick. Don't worry about the shape or how lumpy it is, the more misshapen the better!</li>
			<li>Bake according to Betty Crocker recipe directions.</li>
			<li>Once the cookies are cool, load them up with cookie icing and spread it around with the back of a spoon, let some dribble over the edge for a "puddle" look.</li>
			<li>Spray a microwave safe plate with cooking spray, and place marshmallows on the plate.</li>
			<li>Set the microwave for 30 seconds, but watch the marshmallows as they cook.</li>
			<li>Stop the microwave as soon as the marshmallows start to get puffy, do not let them double in size.</li>
			<li>Spray your fingers with cooking spray or grease them up with shortening, and carefully pull the marshmallows off, by the base, and set them on top of the frosted cookies.</li>
			<li>Then decorate them as you like with the Wilton frosting!	
		</ol>
